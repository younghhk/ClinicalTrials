# Clinical Trials Training Resources

## Overview of Therapeutic Clinical Trials
Clinical research studies can be grouped into therapeutic and non therapeutic trials.

Therapeutic trials give a treatment to participants to study its effect on a disease. These trials help determine safety, effectiveness, and how a treatment should be used in practice.

Non therapeutic trials do not provide a treatment. They collect information that helps advance scientific understanding, such as risk factors, biomarkers, or patient experiences.

Therapeutic trials often progress through three phases.

- Phase I focuses on safety. Researchers test increasing dose levels to identify the maximum tolerated dose and observe early side effects. Patients with different conditions may be included.

- Phase II evaluates whether the treatment shows benefit in a specific patient group. It uses the dose and schedule defined in Phase I.

- Phase III compares the new treatment with the current standard to determine whether it improves outcomes or reduces side effects.
